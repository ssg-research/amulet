# Distribution Inference
Amulet implements the distribution inference attack from the work [Dissecting Distribution Inference](https://github.com/iamgroot42/dissecting_dist_inf) by Suri et. al. published at IEEE SaTML 2023.

## Attack
<!-- To run an distribution inference attack, use `amulet.distribution_inference.attacks.SuriSATML2023`. -->
This attack is a work in progress and will be made available in a future update.

## Defense
Amulet does not currently implement any direct defenses for distribution inference.
[DP-SGD](https://github.com/ssg-research/amulet/blob/main/docs/module_guide/5_MEMBERSHIP_INFERENCE.md#defense) may be used as a general privacy preserving mechanism.

## Metrics
Evaluation for distribution inference is currently a work in progress.
